# My Music Shop/ Bootstrap1
Patika account: https://app.patika.dev/ezgikarali4

The Music Store site consisting of 3 pages that I made using Bootstrap v4.0 is as follows. There are 6 different musical instruments on the products page and they are in the card structure. All sites have navbars. You can switch between pages with this.

You can contact me for your questions or ideas for improving the project.
